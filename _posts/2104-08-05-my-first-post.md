  <em>Since this is my first post ever I decided to start off on sort of a personal note.</em>

  The truth is this year has been beyond wild and crazy for me. First off, this past April I married my best friend who I
have been chasing since grade school. Even Crazier then that was that we had a baby on the way! Baby Oliver
was born exactly one day before I was about to begin another wild adventure at <strong>The Iron Yard</strong>.

  From day one I always knew I wanted to be a contributor to the "World Wide Web". That
being said the path to that goal was never clear. That is until three months ago the opportunity
presented itself to be apart of something awesome. <strong>The Iron Yard</strong>. Three months dedicating towards
pursuing one of my life long dreams to become a Web Developer as a Rails Engineer.

  Sometimes I think it's easy to get overwhelmed with life when it seems to be happening all around you.
When change comes so swift every day becomes and adjustment.

* <strong>adapt</strong>
* <strong>compromise</strong>
* <strong>unconditional love</strong>

  <em>Those have become my life moto's.</em>

  The truth is that life is constantly changing, that is the one thing that will always be the same. While sometimes
daunting change happens and the beauty of it is that even when it causes discomfort it reveals so much
about one's self. The instant love of a father to his son. The love of a husband to his wife.

In this season of life when change seems to come every day.

Challenge excepted! and Cheers to new Beginnings!
